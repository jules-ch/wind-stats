    Parameters
    ----------
    height:
        height where wind speed is evaluated.
    roughness_length:
        roughness length parameter in meters.
    reference_height: float
        reference height where reference wind speed is measured.
    reference_wind_speed: float
        reference wind speed measured at `reference_height`.
    zero_displacement_plane: float
        the height at which the mean velocity is zero due to large obstacles such as buildings/canopy.

    Returns
